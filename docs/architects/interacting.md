# Interacting with Artworks: Download, Hold, & Buy

The MakerForge provides powerful tools for architects and designers to engage with sculptural artworks directly from their dedicated profile pages. Once you've explored an artwork's details, you can utilize three key interactive buttons to integrate it into your design process.

## Interactive Options

On each artwork's profile page, located beneath the artwork details, you will find the following options:

1.  ### **Download**
    * **Purpose:** Instantly access the 3D CAD file for the artwork.
    * **Functionality:** Clicking this button initiates a download of the artwork's precise 3D model.
    * **Benefit:** This feature is crucial for architects and designers, allowing you to incorporate the digital model directly into your architectural designs. This facilitates early-stage visualization, spatial planning, and clash detection, ensuring the artwork fits perfectly within your proposed environment without unforeseen modifications.
    * **Availability:** The CAD file remains available for download by any registered user, even if the artwork is on hold. This ensures flexibility for design exploration by multiple interested parties.

2.  ### **Hold**
    * **Purpose:** Secure an artwork exclusively for a specified period.
    * **Functionality:** For a set, non-refundable cost (which may vary by artwork or duration), you can place a hold on a piece. You will be prompted to confirm the hold duration and cost.
    * **Benefit:** While an artwork is on hold, no other user can place a hold on it or initiate a purchase. This guarantees you a temporary exclusive option to acquire the artwork, giving you time to finalize client approvals or project details without the risk of it being purchased by someone else.
    * **Note:** The CAD file *remains available for download* by any registered user during a hold period. This allows other designers to continue exploring its integration into their own concepts, but they cannot secure the piece for purchase or another hold. If the hold expires or is cancelled, the artwork immediately becomes available for all interactions again.

3.  ### **Buy**
    * **Purpose:** Make a firm commitment to purchase the artwork.
    * **Functionality:** Clicking this button initiates the purchase process, typically involving a secure payment gateway. You will be guided through the necessary steps to complete the transaction.
    * **Benefit:** Once an artwork is bought, it immediately becomes unavailable for other users to download (unless the artist specifically allows continued download for reference), hold, or buy. This signifies its official acquisition by you or your client.
    * **Process:** Upon successful purchase, the artist will be notified of the sale, and arrangements for shipment and installation will commence.

By utilizing these interactive tools, The MakerForge empowers you to seamlessly integrate exceptional sculptural art into your architectural and design projects, from conceptualization to final acquisition.
